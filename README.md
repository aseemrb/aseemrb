I'm a Ph.D. student at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), advised by Prof [Kimon Fountoulakis](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=K-SafJUAAAAJ) and Prof [Aukosh Jagannath](https://math.uwaterloo.ca/~a3jagann/). I am a part of the [OpAL Lab](https://opallab.ca/) and the [A&C group](https://algcomp.uwaterloo.ca/). My research interests broadly span machine learning on graphs and high dimensional probability.
